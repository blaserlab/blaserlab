## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Blaser Lab Github page.  

Our lab is interested in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.  We also have an interest in single cell technologies. This github page is a good place to start if you want to review the code behind the figures for our papers.  From here you can also find the code for our blaseRtools R package.  This is a set of functions we use frequently in the lab related to single cell analysis, image analysis, DNA sequence manipulation, and Chip/ATAC-seq visualization.  

### Analysis projects for papers

You can find links to the public github repos for our data analysis projects by clicking [here](https://github.com/blaserlab?tab=repositories) or on the "Repositories" tab above.  Private repositories are also available to collaborators in this area.  Most are designed to work in concert with a precompiled data package which is publicly distributed through our dryad and privately available on our OSU network drive.  

### blaseRtools

The underlying philosophy of blaseRtools is that we try to reduce the cognitive burden related to working with diverse sets of bioinformatics tools.  We try as rapidly as possible to process and funnel raw data into common data structures that are as simple to understand and work with as possible.  

For an overview of the blaseRtools functions, please click [here](https://blaserlab.github.io/blaseRtools/).  From there you can link to tutorials showing common use-cases for our tools.  The tutorials are identical in content to the vignettes available in R when you install the package.
